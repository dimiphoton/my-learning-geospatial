## My mission

By the end of this course, you will have acquired a solid and detailed understanding of the field of deep learning. 

You will have learned how to design deep neural networks for a wide range of advanced probabilistic inference tasks and how to train them.

These models seen in the course apply to a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems, with plenty of applications in engineering and science.

The (human) brain is so good at interpreting visual information that the **gap** between raw
data and its semantic interpretation is difficult to assess intuitively:

Extracting semantic information requires models of **high complexity**, which cannot be designed by hand.

However, one can write a program that *learns* the task of extracting semantic information.

The common approach used in practice consists of:
- defining a parametric model with high capacity,
- optimizing its parameters, by "making it work" on the training data.

The success of deep learning is multi-factorial...

## Building on the shoulders of giants

Five decades of research in machine learning provided
- a taxonomy of ML concepts (classification, generative models, clustering, kernels, linear embeddings, etc.),
- a sound statistical formalization (Bayesian estimation, PAC),
- a clear picture of fundamental issues (bias/variance dilemma, VC
dimension, generalization bounds, etc.),
- a good understanding of optimization issues,
- efficient large-scale algorithms.

## Deep learning

From a practical perspective, deep learning
- lessens the need for a deep mathematical grasp,
- makes the design of large learning architectures a system/software development task,
- allows to leverage modern hardware (clusters of GPUs),
- does not plateau when using more data,
- makes large trained networks a commodity.
